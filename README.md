TransfromCopy will apply a transformation from one node to another image.
It gives independent control over each transformation.

If you want to installed the build version for nuke12, copy the file from build/nuke12 here and place it in your ".nuke" folder. 
The tool will not be visable inside of nuke. one way to call it is by pressing "X" and type "TransformCopy" and nuke will place a new node. 
another way is to load it on nuke startup using init.py.
